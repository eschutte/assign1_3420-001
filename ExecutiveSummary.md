# Executive Summary
## Reason for having OSS
- The reason for this system is to be able to check the open source for vulnerabilities and the license that goes along with it.  It is also able to compare the policy documents that go along with the software.  A developer submits the software package request and the manager will use OSS to finish the package needs.  This will bring the software into the orginiziation needing this software, giving them published licenses and vulnerabilities that they must now follow as well.

## Overview of DFD
- The developer uses the system to scan OSS packages.  First, you must send the package with the information through the NIST Vulnerability database and a scan for license info.  Then, it will return any vulnerabilities in the lincensing to be modified.  Both the manager and developer an no make requests to now software packages, and can pull the project information on the licenses and vulnerabilities. They can also both compare the information with the current policy documents.  Like the example in case 3 the manager can also make changes to the policies and upload them to the policy database.
