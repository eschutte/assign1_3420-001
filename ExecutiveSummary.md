# Executive Summary
## Reason for having OSS
- The reason for this system is to be able to check the open source for vulnerabilities and the license that goes along with it.  It is also able to compare the policy documents that go along with the software.  A developer submits the software package request and the manager will use OSS to finish the package needs.  This will bring the software into the orginiziation needing this software, giving them published licenses and vulnerabilities that they must now follow as well.
